This package contains the Matlab codes implementing the RLPHCS algorithm described in CVPR'2015 paper "Reweighted Laplace Prior Based Hyperspectral Compressive Sensing for Unknown Sparsity".

Run main_RLPHCS.m to see how the functions are called. 

Urban data is included in folder 'data' can be used for test the code.
